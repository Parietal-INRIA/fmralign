Functional alignment and template estimation library for functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data

This library is meant to be a light-weight Python library that handles functional alignment tasks. It is compatible with and inspired from Nilearn (http://nilearn.github.io).

Alternative implementations of these ideas can be found in the pymvpa (http://www.pymvpa.org) or brainiak (http://brainiak.org) packages.
