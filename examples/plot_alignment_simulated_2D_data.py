"""Alignment on simulated 2D data
===================================================================

As we mentionned several times, we search for a transformation, let's call it
`R`, between the source subject data `X` and the target data `Y`. `X` and `Y`
are arrays of dimensions `(n_voxels, n_samples)` where each image is a sample.
So we can see each signal as a distribution where each voxel as a point
in a multidimensional functional space (each dimension is a sample).

We show below a 2D example, with 2 distributions: `X` in green, `Y` in red.
Both have 20 voxels (points) characterized by 2 samples (images). And the
alignment we search for is the matching of both distibutions, optimally in
some sense.

To run this example, you must launch IPython via ``ipython
--matplotlib`` in a terminal, or use ``jupyter-notebook``.

# Defining utility functions
# --------------------------
# In this example we will do a lot of plotting so we first define :
#   * _rotate to do a 2D rotation for a point from an origin
#   * _plot_mixing_matrix to plot 2D alignment matrix as pretty tables
#   * tick_params which are a set of plotting parameters
#   * _plot2D_samples_mat to plot 2D alignment matrix as matching between distributions.
#   * _plot_distributions_and_alignment to plot both the distributions and the matchings
# Now you can skip this part.

# Alignment : finding the right transform
# ---------------------------------------
# The source and target distributions we created are not well matched. The
# idea of alignment is to find a transform, let's call it `R`, between the
# source `X` and the target `Y` that will handle that. Now we will showcase
# on our simple 2D example different kind of transformation we can look for.

# Orthogonal alignment
# --------------------
# The first idea proposed in Haxby, 2011 was to compute an orthogonal mixing
# matrix `R` and a scaling `sc` such that Frobenius norm: math:
# ` | |sc RX - Y | | ^ 2` is minimized.

# Ridge alignment
# ---------------
# Another simple idea to regularize the transform `R` searched for is to
# penalize its L2 norm. This is a ridge regression, which means we search `R`
# such that Frobenius  norm :math:`|| XR - Y ||^2 + alpha * ||R||^2`
# is minimized with cross-validation.

# Optimal Transport alignment
# ---------------------------
# Finally this package comes with a new method that build on the Wasserstein
# distance which is well-suited for this problem. This is the framework of
# Optimal Transport that search to transport all signal from `X` to `Y`
# while minimizing the overall cost of this transport. `R` is here the
# optimal coupling between `X` and `Y` with entropic regularization.
# This way of finding a transform uses more geometrical information from the
# distributions.
