    abstract = "{Quantifying how brain functional architecture differs from person to person is a key challenge in human neuroscience. Current individualized models of brain functional organization are based on brain regions and networks, limiting their use in studying fine-grained vertex-level differences. In this work, we present the individualized neural tuning (INT) model, a fine-grained individualized model of brain functional organization. The INT model is designed to have vertex-level granularity, to capture both representational and topographic differences, and to model stimulus-general neural tuning. Through a series of analyses, we demonstrate that (a) our INT model provides a reliable individualized measure of fine-grained brain functional organization, (b) it accurately predicts individualized brain response patterns to new stimuli, and (c) for many benchmarks, it requires only 10–20 minutes of data for good performance. The high reliability, specificity, precision, and generalizability of our INT model affords new opportunities for building brain-based biomarkers based on naturalistic neuroimaging paradigms.}",
